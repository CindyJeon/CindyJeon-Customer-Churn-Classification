[Card Company Customer Churn Classification]

1. Intro
Identify patterns and indicators that precede churn by leveraging the power of machine learning.
By doing so, we aim to equip the business with the tools to not only predict potential customer turnover but to take proactive countermeasures to prevent it.

2. Business Question(s)
- What are the specific features associated with a high churn rate?
- What type of classification models are the best to predict churn?
- What do we need to improve the prediction quality?

3. Data (Exploratory Data Analysis)Â 
4. Insights (Predictive Analytics)
  1) Model Performance: The Random Forest shows the best performance which can be used to predict churn in the future
  2) Type 2 Error Analysis: There are 338 case for the type 2 error, which means that the model might not be able to predict real churn as churn for 338 cases
  3)Predictive Power and Business Impact: The insights indicate that while the model can predict churn to a certain degree (evidenced by an AUC of 0.7 mentioned earlier), there is room for improvement to reduce the costs associated with false
   negatives, which in business terms means missed opportunities for customer retention.
  4) Data Limitations and Potential: The current limitation of having only 20% of data related to churn instances presents an insight that the model's predictive power could be significantly improved by increasing the volume of churn-related data.
