# CindyJeon-Customer-Churn-Classification
Identify patterns and indicators that precede churn by leveraging the power of machine learning.
By doing so, we aim to equip the business with the tools to not only predict potential customer turnover 
but to take proactive countermeasures to prevent it.
I used Classification algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine) to predict churn likelihood, providing business insights and prevention solutions.
